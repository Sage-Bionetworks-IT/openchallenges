AWS CDK projects require some bootstrapping before synthesis or deployment.
Please review the [bootstapping documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_bootstrap)
before development.

# Development
The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization
process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the `.venv`
directory.  To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
(or `python` for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
you can create the virtualenv manually.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
them to your `setup.py` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation


# Testing

## Static Analysis
As a pre-deployment step we syntatically validate the CDK json, yaml and
python files with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com).

Please install pre-commit, once installed the file validations will
automatically run on every commit.  Alternatively you can manually
execute the validations by running `pre-commit run --all-files`.

Verify CDK to Cloudformation conversion by running [cdk synth]:
```text
cdk synth
```
The Cloudformation output is saved to the `cdk.out` folder

## Unit Tests

Tests are available in the tests folder. Execute the following to run tests:

```
python -m pytest tests/ -s -v
```

# Deployment

Deployment requires setting up an [AWS profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html) then executing the
following command:

```text
AWS_PROFILE=<your AWS profile> AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<your region> cdk deploy --all
```
